Started taping 'z' and 'x' both tied with a regular tape this can be used as a pseudo-rapid trigger and also it is good if you want to train your taps in a better way or as some recommend light tapping using this taping method only downside maybe on higher bpms it is harder to hold sliders idk my pc is weird and this tape this works interesting could upload a vid on the exact way I tape but idk for now
