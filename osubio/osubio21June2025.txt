Might've stumbled upon Universal fix;
WAait wait so I Alt+TABBED as usual when I noticed my screen looking rough so I took the advantage to switch mid alttabbing resolution so I lowered it one tier to like 1760x990 to my surprise it didn't flicker like usual indicating better Fullscreen effect was like aight, and I gave it a shot since I never did such maneuver little did I know, I get best input I could get last years now I find myself over-tapping(tapping faster at better rates) on higher BPM

Another interesting trick is even at the state where osu! is full screened however launching task manager Ctrl+SHIFT+Esc will stabilize something in the game man I jst hate Bugwindows  My theory goes like this So in Windows the taskmgr windows is highly prioritized leaving it layers below osu! give it strong processing ..

I got a 50s chain on the stream cause without the input-lag Luck today, I wouldn't be hittin' these rather miss all the notes but I deal with this so I'm practiced to overtap at these times.
