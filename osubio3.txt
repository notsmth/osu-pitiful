ok! Please hear me out, if you ever owned a Logitech peripheral especially a wireless keyboard read this steam article https://steamcommunity.com/app/21090/discussions/0/864951657825089435/ my old keyboard which I never connected really to my new PC (one I'm typing on) despite this it left junk so I just followed and read what they say was disable stuff I did and it seems to help.  After this,
